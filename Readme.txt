This is a simple implementation of a Linked List data structure that implements a list interface and encompasses
an implemented Node class that extends a Comparable to data type in order to make the Linked List implementation
abstract and transferable. This particular implementation includes methods to traverse the list, remove a node from the list
and insert new node at random index (O(n) linear time complexity) and to insert a new node at the beginning (O(1) constant time complexity).
